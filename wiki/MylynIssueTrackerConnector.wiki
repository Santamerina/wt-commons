#summary Mylyn Issue Tracker integration notes.

===API===

Google-code does not as of yet (05/2009) have an [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=148 API for the issue tracker].


===Web Connector===

Until it is implemented, the best bet is to use the generic web connector as described in [http://www.jroller.com/alexRuiz/entry/using_mylyn_with_google_code1 this blog entry].

Example repository properties are as follows:

  * *Server:* http://code.google.com/p/wt-commons/issues 
  * *Label:*  wt-commons
  * *Query Request URL:* `${serverUrl}/csv?can=1&colspec=ID+Status+Type+Owner+Summary`
  * *Query Pattern:*     `"({Id}[0-9]+?)","({Status}.+?)","({Type}.+?)","({Owner}.+?)","({Description}.+?)"\s`
