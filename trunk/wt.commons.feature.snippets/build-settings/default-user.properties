#    Specifies the version of source code accepted. The following values for release are allowed:
#valid values
#   1.3 The compiler does not support assertions, generics, or other language features introduced after JDK 1.3.
#   1.4 The compiler accepts code containing assertions, which were introduced in JDK 1.4. 
#   1.5 The compiler accepts code containing generics and other language features introduced in JDK 5. 
#   5   Synonym for 1.5. 
#   1.6 This is the default value. No language changes were introduced in Java SE 6. However, encoding errors in source files are now reported as errors, instead of warnings, as previously. 
#   6   Synonym for 1.6.

#Values for the RCP Target Eclipse is the version that the PDE uses as the source of the plugins that it includes in the RCP 
# or includes on the classpath in the plugin.  The RCP Target Eclipse is created from the Eclipse SDK zip file pointed to by the 
# ${eclipse.target.dir}/${eclipse.target.file} combination.  This archive file is expanded into ${build.eclipse.base} directory. 
# Then to allow the PDE to build for multiple Operating Systems the Eclipse Delta Pack (Eclipse code for all supported Operating Systems) 
# is expanede into the same directory.  The Eclipse Delta Pack archive file is defined by the 
# ${eclipse.deltapack.dir}/${eclipse.deltapack.file} combination.
